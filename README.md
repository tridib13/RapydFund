# RapydFund

RapydFund is a decentralised blockchain crowdfunding application that allows investors to invest in campaigns of their choice with each transaction made from the campaign holder recorded on the blockchain. This maintains transaction records from the campaign wallet protecting from fraudulent campaigns while maintaining transparency

The application is built using a React Js frontend with a Web3 interface that communicates with Solidity Ethereum contracts deployed on test blockchain nets. On the backend, there is an Express server that communicates with Rapyd APIs and provides easy to use endpoints.
